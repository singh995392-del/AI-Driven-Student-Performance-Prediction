# GradeCast – Student Performance Prediction System

## Overview

**GradeCast** is a web-based application designed to predict student performance using machine learning. Built with Flask, it helps forecast a student's likely academic outcome (grade range) and assess academic risk based on multiple input factors. The goal is to empower students, educators, and academic advisors to take informed, proactive measures by offering timely insights and recommendations.

### Docker link: <https://hub.docker.com/r/keneandita/gradecast>

## Key Features

* Clean, intuitive interface for easy student data entry
* Dynamic input support for multiple courses, credit hours, and certificates
* Collects detailed academic information including grades, attendance, and CGPA
* Predicts final grade range and academic risk using Random Forest and Logistic Regression
* Provides personalized feedback based on predictions and input data
* Displays results and recommendations clearly for easy understanding

## Stuff I used

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend**: Python (Flask)
* **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression), pickle
* **Utilities**: Bash scripting for setup and automation

For people looking for the Docker link : [Docker link](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/keneandita/gradecast/general)

~ Note of usage: for people who prefer .py script for training the models, I have made GradeCast.py which will automatically export the required models at their required location. Just run the following bash script

```bash
python GradeCast.py
```

~ If you want to use the notebook which I usually do, Just run each cell with their order and will do the magic for you. You can also make changes without being overwhelmed.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keneandita/gradecast
cd gradecast/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application

Use the included bash script to launch the system:

```bash
python .\GradeCast.py
```

~ Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>

* Keeping in mind that the models exist in the models folder or else run the training script or training notebook to export the models accordingly.

## Results of the models

### Random Forest Regressor

* Mean Squared Error: 0.05
* R² Score: 0.96
